# Full Cycle - Go Challenge

Full Cycle Formation's first proposed activity for the Docker module.

The activity comprises preparing a container that outputs a praising message just like a "Hello World" example, and the objective is to have an image with size less than 2Mb.

The image is published in my personal Docker Hub account as viniciusdacosta/codeeducation.

For  running it

```
docker run viniciusdacosta/codeeducation
```
